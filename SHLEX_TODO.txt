Notes on conversion from pyparsing to shlex taking place in the ply branch

Todo List:
- refactor Cmd2.parseline() to use StatementParser.parse()
- refactor tab completion to use StatementParser instead of parseline()
- self.redirector doesn't really work any more, either make it work or expire it
- clarify Statement.args whether it should be None or '', and whether it should be a string or a list of arguments,
  include verifying documentation in unfreefeatures.txt
- make sure Statement.command_and_args can handle quoted string arguments well. It might have to return a list of args, not a string
- delete SHLEX_TODO.txt once everything is done
