Notes on conversion from pyparsing to shlex taking place in the ply branch

Todo List:
- case sensitive flag
- refactor Cmd2.parseline() to use StatementParser.parse()
- get rid of legalChars
- get rid of POSIX_SHLEX and STRIP_QUOTES_FOR_NON_POSIX - those options should be ignored
- we now ignore self.identchars, which breaks backwards compatibility with the cmd in the standard library
- delete SHLEX_TODO.txt once everything is done

Questions:
- say I have a command called 'fred' which is a multiline command. If I make an alias
  for fred called 'george' is george a multiline command? I think the answer is yes.
  If you want a multi-line synonym for a command that isn't multiline, do it like
  example.py does. If the answer is no, then I need to rework StatementParser.parse()

Changelog Items:
- if self.default_to_shell is true, then redirection and piping is now properly passed to the shell, previously it was truncated
- object passed to do_* methods has changed. It no longer is the pyparsing object, it's a new Statement object. A side effect of this is that we now have a clean interface between the parsing logic and the rest of cmd2. If we need to change the parser in the future, we can do it without breaking anything. The parser is now self.statement_parser instead of self.command_parser.
- input redirection no longer supported. Use the load command instead.
- submenus now call all hooks, it used to just call precmd and postcmd
