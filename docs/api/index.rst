API Reference
=============

These pages document the public API for ``cmd2``. If a method, class, function,
attribute, or constant is not documented here, consider it private and subject
to change. There are many classes, methods, functions, and constants in the
source code which do not begin with an underscore but are not documented here.
When looking at the source code for this library, you can not safely assume
that because something doesn't start with an underscore, it is a public API.

If a release of this library changes any of the items documented here, the
version number will be incremented according to the `Semantic Version
Specification <https://semver.org>`_.

This documentation is for version |version| of ``cmd2``.
